  # when the model will never already stored then use the following:
  # def persisted?
  #   return true  if id.present?
  #   return false # if id.blank?
  # end

#   # All the models that are apart of our form should be part attr_accessor.
#   # This allows the form to be initialized with existing instances.
#   attr_accessor :contact, :attendee, :initiative, :attendee_school

#   # list attributes used in the form
#   attr_accessor :model_id
#
#   # define attributes for input conversion
#   attribute :model_id,       Integer
